# Badge Button
In this example I have used an existing cocoapods [MIBadgeButton](https://github.com/mustafaibrahim989/MIBadgeButton-Swift) to show a badge (a number that is inside a circle at a button's top left corner). 

#How to install
Add the following line into your Podfile:

Swift (3)
```
pod "MIBadgeButton-Swift", :git => 'https://github.com/mustafaibrahim989/MIBadgeButton-Swift.git', :branch => 'master'
```

then run
```
pod install
```
In your project import the MIBadgeButton_Swift, add a variable of type MIBadgeButton, link it to a button in your storyboard.
In identity inspector add a custom class and a Module to your the button you just created. 

Enjoy!
